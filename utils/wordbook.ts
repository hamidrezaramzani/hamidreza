              for technology and coding. I specialize in full-stack development,
              primarily using JavaScript, React for building dynamic user
              interfaces, and Node.js for back-end services. Over the years, I

              web applications, always aiming to provide the best user
              experience. My journey in web development has been driven by a
              desire to continuously learn and stay updated with the latest
              industry trends and tools.`,
